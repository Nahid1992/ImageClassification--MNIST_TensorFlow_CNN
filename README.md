# Image Classification
### MNIST using TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Network
This mini project is based on MNIST dataset. TensorFlow Machine Learning Framework was used with only four layers. 

### Database
The MNIST database of handwritten digits The dataset was downloaded from the built-in function. It can also be found from this [Link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

### Database Properties
This database has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

### Dependencies
* Python 3.6.2
* TensorFlow
